# Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is finding the best fit bewteen the input variable x and the expected variable y, i.e, relationship bewteen an independent variable and a dependent variable. The linear relationship between these two variables can be represented by a straight line called regression line.

Here is the jupyter notebook explaining the concept with example.
