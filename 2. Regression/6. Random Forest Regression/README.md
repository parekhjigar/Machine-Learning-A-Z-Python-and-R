# Random Forest Regression

A Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap Aggregation, commonly known as bagging. Bagging, in the Random Forest method, involves training each decision tree on a different data sample where sampling is done with replacement.
