# Apriori

Apriori is an algorithm used for Association Rule Mining. It searches for a series of frequent sets of items in the datasets. It builds on associations and correlations between the itemsets. It is the algorithm behind “You may also like” where you commonly saw in recommendation platforms.

In ARM(Associate Rule Mining), the frequency of patterns and associations in the dataset is identified among the item sets then used to predict the next relevant item in the set. This ARM technique is mostly used in business decisions according to customer purchases.
