In Reinforcement Learning, we use Multi-Armed Bandit Problem to formalize the notion of decision-making under uncertainty using k-armed bandits. A decision-maker or agent is present in Multi-Armed Bandit Problem to choose between k-different actions and receives a reward based on the action it chooses. Bandit problem is used to describe fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning, such as rewards, timesteps, and values.
