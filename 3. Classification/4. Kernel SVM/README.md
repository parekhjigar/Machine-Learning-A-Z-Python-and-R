# Kernel SVM

SVM algorithms use a set of mathematical functions that are defined as the kernel. The function of kernel is to take data as input and transform it into the required form. Different SVM algorithms use different types of kernel functions. These functions can be different types. For example linear, nonlinear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.
Introduce Kernel functions for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors. The most used type of kernel function is RBF. Because it has localized and finite response along the entire x-axis.
The kernel functions return the inner product between two points in a suitable feature space. Thus by defining a notion of similarity, with little computational cost even in very high-dimensional spaces.
